## Bio

I am a research fellow in the [Vlachos lab](http://non-coding.org/) at the Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Harvard Medical School. My research focuses on two areas: developing 1) Efficient integration of orthogonal high throughput assays 2) Methods to prioritize key cell types and pathways from next generation sequencing data (bulk, single cell, and spatial). I have a broad background in biostatistics, with expertise on harnessing statistical models to solve problems but also extensive experience in translational research and applications. As a researcher in the Vlachos lab and the BIDMC [Spatial Technologies Unit](http://spatialtechnology.org/), I am now leading extensive research efforts integrating cutting-edge single cell and spatial tissue profiling technologies for the investigation of human pathologies.

I received my PhD in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University where I was advised by [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.github.io/) and [Winston Hide](https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/winston-hide-phd).
